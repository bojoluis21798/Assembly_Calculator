Calculator written in x86 Assembly Language with GUI and mouse controls
=======================================================================

###### Assembler: a86

Features:
*	Basic Arithmetic Operations
*	UP TO 2 DIGIT INPUT FOR BOTH OPERANDS
*	Regards Negative Output
*	Regards Undefined Output when dividing a number by 0
*	It's pink :D

Bugs I can't fix because I'm too stupid:
*	Limiting user input to avoid accepting more than 2 digits but it crashes when there's an input
	overflow of more than 3 digits for both operands.
*	Limiting user input to avoid accepting more than 1 operator after accepting the first operand,
	crashes when there's an input overflow of more than 3 operators.
